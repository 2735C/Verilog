2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_CLK_DIV_100/w_run_stop_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count[26]_i_3/O, cell U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count[26]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count[26]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 28 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
U_CLK_DIV_100/r_clk_reg, U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[0],
U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[10], U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[11],
U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[12], U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[13],
U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[14], U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[15],
U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[16], U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[17],
U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[18], U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[19],
U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[1], U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[20],
U_CLK_DIV_100/r_count_reg[21] (the first 15 of 28 listed)
Related violations: <none>
